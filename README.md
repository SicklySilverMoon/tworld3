# Tile World 3??

This is the repository for a currently semi-hypothetical Tile World 3, a
completely new version of Tile World with the logic borrowed and cleaned up from
the original Tile World project, and the UI completely redone. The current focus
is on remaking the logic code, packaged in a separate library called `libchips`.

## libchips

`libchips` is an implementation of the core game logic of the Lynx and Windows
versions of the game Chip's Challenge. It is based on Tile World, but refactored
to have clearer and more modern code.

Progress:

- Lynx: code mostly ported sans `Actor_enter_tile`, check TODOs
- MS: finished
- DAT: finished
- TWS: not started
- JSON/Routefile: not started
- (maybe) NCCS: not started
